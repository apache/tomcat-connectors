# uriworkermap.properties
#
# Use for IIS or with the Apache web server as an alternative
# to JkMount and JkUnmount
#
# This file provides sample mappings for the example
# worker "balancer" defined in workermap.properties.
# The general syntax for this file is:
# [URL]=[Worker name]

/admin/*=balancer
/manager/*=balancer
/examples/*=balancer

# Optionally filter out all .jpg files inside that context
# For no mapping the url has to start with exclamation mark (!)

!/examples/*.jpg=balancer

#
# Mount jk status and manager
# For production servers you will need to
# secure the access to the /jk-manager and
# /jk-status urls
#
/jk-manager=jk-manager
/jk-status=jk-status
