How to do a mod_jk 1.2 Release
==============================

Clone a clean copy of tomcat/connectors from git to make sure you don't have
any lingering configure or build files. This will make sure that the source
distribution created is clean.

We assume, that you cloned out git@github.com:apache/tomcat-connectors.git
to a directory named mod_jk. All further path names will be relative to this
directory.

If you haven't already, add your public PGP key to KEYS.

Add a preliminary note about the new release to the docs
--------------------------------------------------------

Candidate pages are:

xdocs/index.xml
xdocs/news/<THISYEAR0101>.xml

We can't add a final release date though.

Update version numbers as needed
--------------------------------

Do a find for all the docs which include the previous version string
and replace it with the new version.  These are the docs I found which
had to be updated:

native/iis/README
xdocs/build.xml
xdocs/index.xml
xdocs/news/<THISYEAR0101>.xml
tools/dist/README.html
tools/dist/binaries/windows/README.html

Check version numbers in the files that are listed in the section
"Update source for next version" below:

native/configure.ac
native/common/jk_version.h
xdocs/miscellaneous/changelog.xml

After updating revision numbers, commit your changes to git.

Tag tomcat-connectors in git
----------------------------

Use the pattern below for tagging the tomcat-connectors directory.

TAG=JK_{MAJOR_REVISION}_{MINOR_REVISION}_{RELEASE}

Here is an example for mod_jk 1.2.51

git commit -a -m "Tag JK_1_2_51"
git tag JK_1_2_51
git push origin JK_1_2_51
# reset main


Build the mod_jk 1.2 documentation
----------------------------------

cd xdocs
ant


After checking the documentation carefully (produced in build/docs),
see https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/site/trunk/README.txt?view=markup
for instructions on how to deploy the site docs.

Create the new source distribution
----------------------------------

A tool named jkrelease.sh in the directory tools creates
a release tarball and a zip including signature files.

Here is an example for mod_jk 1.2.51

./jkrelease.sh -R git -v 1.2.51 -h



Upload source distribution and documentation to www.apache.org
-------------------------------------------------------------------
First update the KEYS on the server if you have added a new pgp key.

scp KEYS to the
/www/www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors
directory on the people.apache.org server.

scp tomcat-connectors-1.2.29-src.tar.gz* to 
/www/www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/source
scp tomcat-connectors-1.2.29-src.zip* to   
/www/www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/source

ssh to people.apache.org and cd to the
/www/www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk directory.

Modify README.html and update it to the current version.

Remove the symlinks for current if present and replace them with a soft link
to the new source distribution files.

ln -s source/tomcat-connectors-1.2.29-src.tar.gz tomcat-connectors-src-current.tar.gz
ln -s source/tomcat-connectors-1.2.29-src.tar.gz.asc tomcat-connectors-src-current.tar.gz.asc
ln -s source/tomcat-connectors-1.2.29-src.tar.zip tomcat-connectors-src-current.zip
ln -s source/tomcat-connectors-1.2.29-src.zip.asc tomcat-connectors-src-current.zip.asc

Make sure the group write bit is set on all files and directories
in the jk directory.

chmod -R g+w /www/www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk

Build binaries and upload distributions to www.apache.org
--------------------------------------------------------------

Build mod_jk for a specific web server and OS.  Package it as appropriate for
the OS and sign the archive using PGP. Please include the ASF License, the
generated docs, and the tools.  Please name the distribution as follows:

tomcat-connectors-{version}-{os-version-cpu}-{web server-version}.(tar.gz|zip)

scp the binary distribution and pgp signature file to the appropriate binaries/{os} directory.

Make sure the group write bit is on for all files you upload.

Update source for next version
------------------------------

native/configure.ac: Update version in AC_INIT macro.
native/common/jk_version.h: Update variables JK_VERMAJOR, JK_VERMINOR, JK_VERFIX,
                            JK_VERSTRING, and JK_VERISRELEASE.
xdocs/miscellaneous/changelog.xml: Start a new section for the new version.

Remove old release distributions from www.apache.org
----------------------------------------------------

Verify that the old versions of the source and binary distributions are
available at /www/archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk .
Copy old source distributions and binaries as needed, then remove the
old source and binary distributions.

Arrange the downloads_tomcat-connectors.cgi
-------------------------------------------

Check tomcat-site out:

svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/site site-tomcat

Arrange the file: xdocs/download-connectors.xml, updating all occurrences
of the version number to the just released version.

Update xdocs/index.xml to reflect the new release of Tomcat Connectors.

Run ant from the site-tomcat directory to regenerate the corresponding html file:
docs/site/download-connectors.html

Commit it after checking carefully the changes.

Connect to people.apache.org and update the tomcat.apache.org site image,
the site tomcat.apache.org should reflect the change after a while:

cd /x1/www/tomcat.apache.org/site/downloads
svn update downloads_tomcat-connectors.html

Announcements
-------------

The release distribution directories are mirrored so that the
releases can be downloaded from multiple sites.  Please wait
24 hours before sending out the announcement so that the mirrors
get a chance to get the new release distributions.

Send an email announcement to announce@tomcat.apache.org,
users@tomcat.apache.org, dev@tomcat.apache.org and
announce@apache.org.
