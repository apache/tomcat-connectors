<h2><a name="binaries">Binary Releases</a></h2>
<p>Are available in the <a href="binaries/">binaries/</a> directory.
   Every binary distribution contains an install script. See README 
   for details.
</p>

<h2><a name="releases">Current Releases</a></h2>
<p>For details on current releases, please see the 
   <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi">Apache Tomcat
   Connectors Download Page</a>.
</p>
<p>Note; the -src.zip versions of Apache Tomcat Connectors are nearly identical to the
   .tar.gz versions. However, they offer the source files in DOS/Windows
   CR/LF text format, and include the Winows build files.
   These -src.zip files <strong>do NOT contain binaries!</strong>
   See the <a href="binaries/windows/">binaries/windows/</a>
   directory for the Windows binary distributions.
</p>

<h2><a name="archive">Older Releases</a></h2>
<p>Only current, recommended releases are available on www.apache.org
   and the mirror sites.  Older releases can be obtained from the
   <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/">archive site</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="sig">PGP Signatures</a></h2>
<p>All of the release distribution packages have been digitally signed
   (using PGP or GPG) by the Apache Tomcat Group members that constructed them.
   There will be an accompanying <SAMP><EM>distribution</EM>.asc</SAMP> file
   in the same directory as the distribution.  The PGP keys can be found
   at the MIT key repository and within this project's
   <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/KEYS">KEYS file</a>.
</p>

<p>Always use the signature files to verify the authenticity
   of the distribution, <i>e.g.</i>,</p>

<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv tomcat-connectors-1.2.49-src.tar.gz.asc
<i>or</i>,
% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp tomcat-connectors-1.2.49-src.tar.gz.asc
<i>or</i>,
% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify tomcat-connectors-1.2.49-src.tar.gz.asc
</pre>

<p>We provide SHA512 hashes as an alternative to validate the integrity
   of the downloaded files. The program <code>sha512sum<code> is included
   in many unix distributions. They are also available as part of <a
   href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU
   Coreutils</a>.  Windows users can use <a
