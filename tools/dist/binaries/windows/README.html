<h2><a name="warnings">Windows Users, Read These First...</a></h2>

<h3><strong>Warning:</strong> TCP/IP networking must be installed</h3>

<p>TCP/IP must be correctly installed, configured and running in 
   order to install and use Apache Tomcat Connectors on Windows.</p>

<h3><strong>Warning</strong> about the Quality of Service driver</h3>

<p>We suggest disabling the "Quality of Service" (or QoS) network driver from 
   Microsoft if you primarily use the machine as an Web Server, as connector
   does not support the QoS extensions to the WinSock API.</p>

<h3><strong>Warning</strong> about Firewall and similar software</h3>

<p>Most Firewall programs, Web Spam filters and other TCP/IP driver-based
   products (including spyware!) do not correctly implement the entire WinSock
   API. The shortcuts taken by the developers of such products could cause
   connector to fail.
</p>

<h2><a name="released">The current stable release is 1.2.46</a></h2>

<p>See the Apache Tomcat Connectors
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/miscellaneous/changelog.html">changelog</a>
for the complete list of features and bugs fixed in this release.</p>

<h2><a name="source">Debugging and Source Code</a></h2>

<p>You can find a corresponding -symbols.zip archive of the
   debugging databases in the <a href="symbols/#symbols">symbols/</a>
   directory, these are typically not needed.  This -symbols.zip
   archive can be unpacked into the web server installation directory, providing
   all of the .pdb diagnostic files allowing most Windows debugging tools
   (and the Dr. Watson utility) to produce useful crash analysis.</p>

<p>You will find the source code package in the 
   <a href="../../../jk/">/dist/tomcat-connectors/jk/</a> source tree.  The -src.zip file
   contains <strong>only</strong> source and build files, and contains 
   <strong>no</strong> binary executable files.</p>

<p>This binary release was created with Microsoft Windows DDK 7.1,
   using a more recent Platform SDK.
